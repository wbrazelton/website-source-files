# Abstract

The Lost City hydrothermal ﬁeld on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge supports dense microbial life on the lofty calcium carbonate chimney structures. The vent ﬁeld is fueled by chemical reactions between the ultramaﬁc rock under the chimneys and ambient seawater. These serpentinization reactions provide reducing power (as hydrogen gas) and organic compounds that can serve as microbial food; the most abundant of these are methane and formate. Previous studies have characterized the interior of the chimneys as a single-species bioﬁlm inhabited by the Lost City Methanosarcinales, but they also indicated that this methanogen is unable to metabolize formate. The new metagenomic results presented here indicate that carbon cycling in these Lost City chimney bioﬁlms could depend on the metabolism of formate by Chloroﬂexi populations. Additionally, we present evidence for metabolically diverse, formate-utilizing Sulfurovum populations and new genomic and phylogenetic insights into the unique Lost City Methanosarcinales.
