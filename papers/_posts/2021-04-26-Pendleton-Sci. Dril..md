# Abstract

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357: “Serpentinization and Life” drilled shallow cores into the Atlantis Massif near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in October 2015 using seabed drills. Serpentinization and other geochemical processes occurring within the Atlantis Massif release hydrogen, methane, and other chemicals that can potentially fuel microorganisms through chemosynthesis. The subseaﬂoor rock cores collected during IODP Exp. 357 are the ﬁrst of their kind, meaning the analysis and interpretation of these samples required new methodologies, including a specialized approach for distinguishing endemic subsurface inhabitants from potential contaminants from various sources. Background samples of various potential contamination sources were collected during sampling: 109 samples of seawater collected before, during, and after drilling; 20 samples of greases and oils associated with the drilling equipment; and samples of the laboratory’s ambient air. Despite the widespread usage of drilling lubricants and the importance of controlling contamination in drill-core samples for microbiological analyses, no studies to date have looked at DNA in drilling greases and oils. In this study, drilling lubricants were analyzed as possible sources of microbial contamination of subseaﬂoor rock core samples by environmental sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. We ﬁnd that microbial signatures from drilling lubricants are only found in low abundance in seaﬂoor samples (at most a few percent of total sequence counts), with laboratory contaminants being a greater source of contamination.
