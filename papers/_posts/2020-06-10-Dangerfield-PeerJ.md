# Abstract

The decomposition of carrion is carried out by a suite of macro- and micro-organisms who interact with each other in a variety of ecological contexts. The ultimate result of carrion decomposition is the recycling of carbon and nutrients from the carrion back into the ecosystem. Exploring these ecological interactions among animals and microbes is a critical aspect of understanding the nutrient cycling of an ecosystem. Here we investigate the potential impacts that vertebrate scavenging may have on the microbial community of carrion. In this study, we placed seven juvenile domestic cow carcasses in the Grassy Mountain region of Utah, USA and collected tissue samples at periodic intervals. Using high-depth environmental sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and camera trap data, we documented the microbial community shifts associated with decomposition and with vertebrate scavenger visitation. The remarkable scarcity of animals at our study site enabled us to examine natural carrion decomposition in the near absence of animal scavengers. Our results indicate that the microbial communities of carcasses that experienced large amounts of scavenging activity were not significantly different than those carcasses that observed very little scavenging activity. Rather, the microbial community shifts reflected changes in the stage of decomposition similar to other studies documenting the successional changes of carrion microbial communities. Our study suggests that microbial community succession on carrion follows consistent patterns that are largely unaffected by vertebrate scavenging.
