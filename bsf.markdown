The Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah are famous for their other-worldly appearance and as a site where numerous vehicle land speed records have been set.
Despite the sterile appearance of the salt flats, they host remarkably robust microbial communities that are visibly evident just below the top layer of crust.

Evaporite deposits such as the Bonneville Salt Flats are useful analogs for investigating the potential for ancient and modern life in saline conditions of extraterrestrial settings, including on Mars.
Jezero Crater, the landing site for the Mars Perseverance Rover, contains sedimentary deposits expected to be the remnants of an ancient, now desiccated lake.
Similarly, the Bonneville Salt Flats are the remnants of Lake Bonneville, the largest lake in western North America before it began to desiccate ~15,000 years ago.

Recent research at the Bonneville Salt Flats has been led by [Brenda Bowen](https://environment.utah.edu/brenda-bowen/).
This research has been highly interdisciplinary, including geology, microbiology, and sociology.

A scientist-artist collaboration by Brenda Bowen and Wendy Wischer produced this [art exhibition about the Bonneville Salt Flats.](https://www.granaryarts.org/wendy-wischer-brenda-bowen-evaporated-explorations-in-art-science-and-salt)
