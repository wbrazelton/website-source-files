The map consists of 264 markers, including sequence-tagged sites (STS), scored by use of PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis, and restriction fragment length polymorphism markers, scored by use of Southern blot hybridization. All molecular markers tested map to one of the 17 known linkage groups of               C. reinhardtii               . The map covers approximately 1,000 centimorgans (cM). Any position on the               C. reinhardtii               genetic map is, on average, within 2 cM of a mapped molecular marker. This molecular map, in combination with the ongoing mapping of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the forthcoming sequence of the               C. reinhardtii               nuclear genome, should greatly facilitate isolation of genes of interest by using positional cloning methods. In addition, the presence of easily assayed STS markers on each arm of each linkage group should be very useful in mapping new mutations in preparation for positional cloning.","2003-04","2021-12-22 16:08:24","2021-12-22 16:08:24","2021-12-22 16:08:24","362-379","","2","2","","Eukaryot Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/braz/Dropbox/Papers/collections/Kathir et al. - 2003 - Molecular Map of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
