## Lost City Hydrothermal Field
The Lost City is a beautiful seafloor formation with unique scientific and cultural value. It is under consideration for [special protection by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre and International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://whc.unesco.org/en/highseas). The Lost City is also featured in many studies on the origin of life and the search for life in the solar system.

## "Return to Lost City" Expedition
In 2018, the "Return to Lost City" expedition, aboard the [R/V Atlantis](http://www.whoi.edu/main/ships/atlantis) with [ROV Jason](http://www.whoi.edu/ndsfVehicles/Jason/), collected many high-quality samples of venting fluids and chimney biofilms from the Lost City hydrothermal field.
The expedition was [funded by the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1536702) with additional support from the [NASA Astrobiology Institute Rock-Powered Life Team](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/rockpoweredlife/), the Sloan Foundationâ€™s [Deep Carbon Observatory](https://sloan.org/programs/research/deep-carbon-observatory), and the NSF-funded [Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations](https://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/).
